# Hi, I'm Vivek Kadari! 👋

I'm a passionate **Cyber Security Analyst** with over 3 years of experience in network security, threat detection, vulnerability management, and incident response. I'm currently diving deeper into **penetration testing**, building home lab projects to sharpen my skills and strengthen digital defenses.

🌟 **Why Cybersecurity?** My journey began when I uncovered a critical vulnerability during a college project, sparking a passion for securing systems and outsmarting attackers.

## 🚀 What I Do
- **Network Security**: Secure enterprise and cloud environments (AWS, Azure, GCP) using Splunk, QRadar, and Palo Alto firewalls. Reduced network intrusion attempts by 25% in my last role.
- **Vulnerability Management**: Conduct regular assessments with Nessus and Tenable.io, mitigating 100+ critical vulnerabilities annually.
- **Incident Response**: Lead real-time threat detection and response using SIEM tools like Splunk and QRadar, creating custom playbooks for faster incident resolution.
- **Penetration Testing**: Perform internal and external pentests using Metasploit, Burp Suite, and Kali Linux. Check out my [pentest lab repo](#) for a custom vulnerable web app I built!
- **Cloud Security**: Enhance security for AWS, Azure, and GCP using GuardDuty, Azure Defender, and native IAM best practices.
